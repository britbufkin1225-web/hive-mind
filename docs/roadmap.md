# Hive|Mind Roadmap

This roadmap summarizes the current product state, the active implementation
direction, completed capability groups, paused work, and known limitations. It is
the status overview for Hive|Mind; detailed phase rationale remains in the linked
planning, QA, release, and architecture documents.

## Current State

Hive|Mind is a local-first, graph-primary knowledge intelligence workspace. The
implemented product imports developer-owned sources explicitly, normalizes them
into a local store, projects them into a read-only Knowledge Graph, and derives
deterministic intelligence surfaces from existing records.

Implemented runtime capabilities include:

- Source Registry metadata and explicit Obsidian import.
- Normalized local store records and read-only graph projection.
- Graph-primary frontend shell with contextual overlays, inspector behavior, and
  console command surface.
- Intelligence Report sections for temporal decay, dreaming suggestions,
  provenance chains, and query trails, all bounded by available store evidence.
- Spatial Hive presentation behavior: graph-first shell, 2.5D depth tiers,
  deterministic living-hive motion, focus state, transient interaction state,
  pointer orbit, momentum, and elastic node manipulation.
- Motion sandbox foundation using MediaPipe hand landmarks, with live gesture
  tuning still paused.
- Active Memory foundation through Phase 37E: contract types, deterministic
  backend-only in-memory store, deterministic backend-only read-only
  contradiction detection, and backend-only deterministic context packet
  generation.

The product remains local, single-user, and review-oriented. It does not run
autonomous agents, mutate repositories, persist Active Memory beyond the current
serialize/restore boundary, expose context packets through an endpoint, or
authorize actions from packet data.

## Active Phase

### Phase 37F — Active-memory Frontend Inspector

Phase 37F is the next planned implementation phase on Track 2 — Agent
Intelligence Infrastructure.

The goal is to expose Active Memory state for human inspection without claiming
autonomous action, hidden mutation, automatic resolution, or repository
observation. Phase 37E implemented backend-only deterministic packet generation;
active-state calculation, endpoints, frontend inspection surfaces, repository
observers, and AI/LLM interpretation remain planned work unless a later phase
explicitly implements them.

## Immediate Sequence

| Phase | Status | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 37E — Pre-Action Context Packet MVP | Implemented | Generates a bounded, deterministic, read-only backend context packet from implemented Active Memory contracts, store records, and contradiction results. |
| Phase 37F — Active-memory frontend inspector | Next planned | Expose Active Memory state for human inspection without claiming autonomous action or hidden mutation. |
| Phase 37G — Agent session ingestion planning | Planned | Plan governed ingestion from session artifacts into evidence-backed records. |
| Phase 37H — Repository observer planning | Planned | Plan repository-observer workflows and trust boundaries before any watcher/runtime automation exists. |

Track 1 — Spatial Interaction remains paused at Phase 36K and is not the active
implementation track.

## Completed Capability Groups

### Core Platform and Storage

- Phase 1 established the app foundation, local project boundaries, and initial
  backend/frontend separation.
- The backend grew a local JSON-backed `HiveStore`, source registry records,
  API contracts, and deterministic read paths.
- The frontend evolved from dashboard panels into a graph-primary workspace while
  keeping graph exploration read-only.
- Validation practices settled around backend `pytest`, frontend TypeScript/Vite
  checks, and narrow evidence documents for UI/runtime claims.

### Obsidian Import

- The Obsidian track implemented explicit one-shot import from developer-owned
  notes, source registration, normalized nodes/edges, and provenance-aware
  source metadata.
- Import remains explicit and local. There is no live vault watcher and no
  write-back into Obsidian.

### Knowledge Graph and Intelligence

- The Knowledge Graph is implemented as the primary inspection surface over
  normalized records.
- Temporal Decay, Dreaming Suggestions, Provenance Chains, and Query Trails are
  implemented as deterministic, backend-derived, read-only Intelligence Report
  sections.
- Remaining intelligence work includes richer source coverage, query-history
  persistence, selected-node provenance extensions, and per-section error states.
  These remain read-only and do not imply AI/LLM reasoning.

### Security and Release Readiness

- Security planning and regression passes documented local-only threat modeling,
  backend validation/error safety, selected edge-case hardening, and demo-release
  readiness.
- The current posture is demo/developer-tool readiness, not production security.
  Authentication, authorization, rate limiting, audit logging, cloud deployment
  hardening, and multi-user controls remain out of scope.

### Frontend and Spatial Hive Evolution

- The UI moved from dashboard-with-panels toward a graph-first shell with
  overlays, command surfaces, and a persistent graph viewport.
- Spatial Hive work added 2.5D depth, deterministic living-hive motion,
  focus-state behavior, transient interaction state, pointer orbit, momentum,
  and elastic node manipulation.
- MediaPipe hand-tracking foundations exist, including full-hand landmark
  feature extraction and a motion sandbox. Live gesture feel/tuning and evidence
  remain paused under Phase 36K.

### Active Memory and Verification

- **Phase 37A — Active Agent Memory + Verification Layer Planning:** complete
  documentation-only architecture for evidence-backed project memory, separate
  verification/lifecycle axes, contradiction handling, active-state calculation,
  and pre-action context packets.
- **Phase 37B — Active Memory Contract Types / Schema Alignment:** implemented
  backend Pydantic models and mirrored frontend TypeScript types for
  `active-memory.v1`, including memory records, evidence records, verification
  state, lifecycle state, contradiction records, active-state results, and context
  packet shapes.
- **Phase 37C — Deterministic Active Memory Store MVP:** implemented a
  backend-only in-memory store over `MemoryRecord` with duplicate-id rejection,
  explicit not-found behavior, deterministic listing/filtering, lifecycle
  transitions, defensive copies, and a versioned serialize/restore boundary.
- **Phase 37D — Deterministic Active Memory Contradiction Detection MVP:**
  implemented, validated, and merged. It adds a backend-only, read-only detector
  over the 37C store that derives contract-valid contradiction records from
  stored fields. Supported classes are `pending_vs_merged`,
  `clean_vs_dirty_working_tree`, `duplicate_phase_status`, and
  `current_vs_superseded_decision`. Results use stable content-derived ids,
  conservative trim/casefold normalization, `active`-only lifecycle eligibility,
  preserved evidence, and stable ordering. The detector mutates nothing and never
  auto-resolves a contradiction.
- **Phase 37E — Deterministic Pre-Action Context Packet MVP:** implemented. It
  adds a backend-only, read-only packet builder over the 37C store and 37D
  detector. The builder uses caller-supplied timestamps, exact project and
  optional exact scope filtering, active-record kind partitioning, unresolved
  contradiction inclusion, lifecycle warnings for non-active records, verification
  counts, rigid prohibited-assumption templates, and empty top-level evidence
  references until a real evidence resolver exists. It adds no endpoint,
  frontend surface, persistence, action authorization, automatic contradiction
  resolution, or dependency.

`frontend_only_vs_backend_modification` is a contract class but is not
implemented in Phase 37D because it needs a deterministic path/scope target model
that does not yet exist.

## Paused Track

### Phase 36K — Full-Hand Gesture Live Camera QA + Control Tuning

Phase 36K is paused and untouched. It is not canceled, completed, resumed, or
superseded by the Active Memory track.

The paused work is live-camera QA and conservative control tuning for the
full-hand gesture foundation. Existing synthetic and non-camera validation does
not prove live hand-motion feel. No new webcam evidence is claimed here.

## Deferred / Future Work

| Area | Future direction | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active Memory persistence | Choose a durable medium after contracts, store semantics, contradiction detection, and context packet generation are stable. | Current store is in-memory with serialize/restore only. |
| Active-state calculation | Derive safe active baselines while preserving unresolved contradictions and missing evidence. | No "newest wins"; unresolved state must stay visible. |
| Context packet endpoint/UI | Add reviewed runtime surfaces after Phase 37E generation logic. | No endpoint or frontend inspector exists yet. |
| Repository observer | Plan before implementation; keep evidence scoped and human-reviewable. | No watcher or automatic repository mutation exists. |
| AI/LLM integration | Consider only after deterministic trust boundaries and inspection surfaces are stable. | No AI truth arbitration, autonomous resolution, or autonomous action. |
| Intelligence report expansion | Source coverage, query persistence, and richer provenance/error states. | Read-only derivation over real store data. |
| Spatial interaction | Resume Phase 36K when the project chooses to return to live gesture tuning. | No gesture completion claim without live evidence. |
| Production hardening | Auth, authorization, rate limits, deployment controls, secret handling, and audit logging. | Current app is a local developer tool, not a production service. |

## Current Limitations

- Hive|Mind is local and single-user.
- There is no authentication, authorization, multi-user mode, cloud sync, or
  production deployment hardening.
- Obsidian import is explicit and one-shot; there is no live watcher or
  write-back.
- The Knowledge Graph and Intelligence Report are read-only; suggestions are
  advisory only.
- Query-history persistence does not exist, so query-history-dependent
  intelligence categories remain blocked.
- Active Memory currently has contracts, a deterministic in-memory backend store,
  deterministic read-only contradiction detection, and backend-only context
  packet generation. It does not yet have committed persistence, endpoint
  exposure, ingestion, active-state calculation, frontend inspection, repository
  observation, evidence resolution, action authorization, or automatic
  resolution.
- Gesture tracking remains experimental; Phase 36K live camera tuning is paused.
